1. Search for a substring in a string. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm
2 . Counting the number of occurrences of each prefix
3 . Let us compute the prefix function for s. 
    Using the last value of it we define the value k=n−π[n−1]. 
    We will show, that if k divides n, then k will be the answer, 
    otherwise there doesn't exists an effective compression and the answer is n .
