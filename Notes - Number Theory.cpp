1 : GCD property :  
    For non-negative integers a and b, where a and b are not both zero, provable by considering the Euclidean algorithm in base n :

    // gcd((n^a) − 1, (n^b) − 1) = (n^gcd(a,b)) − 1

2 : GCD and LCM relations , It is based on the formula that , 
  
    // LCM(A , B) × GCD( A , B) = A × B
    
3 : Number of divisors (NOD) of a number N can be calculated using Prime power factorization.
    Let , N = P1^a1 * P2^a2 * P3^a3 * ... * Pn^ak , is the prime power factorization of a number N , where P is the prime number and
    a is number of times occurs that prime number.
    Then , NOD(N) defines as :

    // NOD(N) = (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * (a3 + 1) * ... * (ak + 1)

4 : Sum of divisors (SOD) of a number N can be calculated using prime power factorization.
   Let ,  N = P1^a1 * P2^a2 * P3^a3 * ... * Pn^ak , s the prime power factorization of a number N , where P is the prime number and
    a is number of times occurs that prime number.
  Then , SOD(N) defines as :
  
    // SOD(N) = (P1^0 + P1^1 + p1^2 + ... + P1^a1) * (P2^0 + P2^1 + P2^2 + ... + P2^a2) * (Pk^0 + Pk^1 + ... + Pk^ak)
